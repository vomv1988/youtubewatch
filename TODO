1.	Make the second argument optional. Make default format 5.
2.	If format 5 is unavailable, default to 36, 83, or exit with error.
3.	Make DOWNLOAD_DIR and BUFF_DELAY optional.
3.	Add option parser with bash_optionmaker:
		https://github.com/vomv1988/bash_optionmaker
	Run the following tests for options:
		For DOWNLOAD_DIR, test for directoy existence
		For BUFF_DELAY and video format (2.), test for purely numerical
		string.
		For youtube URL, test for correct syntax (youtube.com/watch?v=xxxx)
4.	Make removal prompt optional by boolean variable '-r' or something.
NOTE:	Point 2 seems complicated. Perhaps it is better to skip it.

1.	Specify nature of error in blank line USAGE error
2.	Comment recommended directory ~/youtube
3.	Consider using
	YOUTUBE-DL_EXIT=`{ youtube-dl ; echo $? ; } &`
	To determine the nature of exit error, and maybe then implement 2.
4.	Recommend links2 -g for browsing youtube and copying YT URLs with
	Alt+f - c
